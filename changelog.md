- Fix an issue where the `USING_CONTAINERS` environment variable would be duplicated in environment files set up by
  `tric` init command.

- Add support for the `TRIC_HOST` environment variable. This will override the default host machine IP address lookup `tric` would perform on Linux or the hard-wired `host.docker.internal` hostname `tric` would use on Windows and Mac host to set the default `xdebug.remote_host` value.
- Default to the host machin IP address to set `xdebug.remote_host` only if the host has not been set  by means of a call to `tric xdebug host <host>` or by setting the `XDH` environment variable explicitly.
- Fix an issue that would reset run settings stored in the `.env.tric.run` file when using the `tric xdebug <key> <value>` command.

## [0.5.14] - 2020-11-24

- Fixed volumes setup to make sure the volume, and the host file structure, created by WordPress container is owned by the current user and not `root`.
- Fixed and issue that would change, on Linux, the file modes of all the used plugins, to `a+rwx` when using the `run` command; fixes #36

## [0.5.13] - 2020-11-23

- `tric info` now outputs all valid targets, which is what `tric use` without a valid target used to do.
