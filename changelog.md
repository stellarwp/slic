- Feature - Add the `slic php-version` command and allow for switching between PHP versioned containers.

- Fix - PHP 8.0+ compatibility fix for WordPress zip downloads.

## [1.0.5] - 2022-09-02

- Switch the `slic-stack.yml` to use the new Docker images for `slic` and `slic-wordpress`.

## [1.0.4] - 2022-09-02

- Generate Docker images for `slic` and `wordpress` containers.

## [1.0.3] - 2022.09-02

- Fixes for the run command when executed while the containers are not already running.
- Scaffold in a `/cache` directory to store test-related information.
- PHP 8 deprecation warning fix.

## [1.0.2] - 2022-09-02

- Ensure that the right flags are passed during docker-compose command execution when in non-interactive mode.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-09-01

- Consolidated many of the containers into a single `slic` container to simplify the stack and reduce the time to start up and shut down containers.
- Containers are no longer brought down upon completion of a command.
- Removed the `serve` command. Since containers remain up, the `up` command can be used to start the stack and make the local site available.
- Reworked how `slic` handles npm. It now uses `nvm` under the hood and automatically installs the version of node that is dictated by `.nvmrc`.
- Removed the `npm_lts` command. It is no longer needed after the reworking of the `npm` command.

- Added the `host-ip` command to get the host machine IP address containers will be able to use to connect to the host (e.g. when setting up XDebug on Linux).

## [0.5.27] - 2021-06-03

## [0.5.26] - 2021-03-05

## [0.5.25] - 2021-03-02

  file being created in the root directory of the current target.

- Update the WordPress image version, in the `tric-stack.build.yml` file, from `5.5` to `5.6` to fix CI build issues.

## [0.5.23] - 2021-01-20

  using `tric reset wp`.

## [0.5.22] - 2021-01-20

- Added the `composer-cache` command so the host machine's composer cache can be leveraged within tric containers.

## [0.5.21] - 2021-01-19

- Updated default WordPress image to `5.6-apache`.

## [0.5.20] - 2020-12-28

- Updated default repo org to `the-events-calendar`.

## [0.5.19] - 2020-12-11

- Fix an issue where commands that required a ready and available WordPress installation in the `tric` WordPress
  directory would not take care to scaffold and install it; e.g. `cli` or `site-cli`.

## [0.5.18] - 2020-12-07

- Fix an issue where the `USING_CONTAINERS` environment variable would be duplicated in environment files set up by
  `tric` init command.
- Fix an issue where a negative answer to build targets with sub-directories, e.g. TEC and ET, would result in the
  target being built anyway.

## [0.5.17] - 2020-12-04

- Fix the XDebug version and `wordpress` service `Dockerfile` to keep using version `2` and not update to version `3` on a rebuild (e.g. one triggered by `tric update` or `tric build-stack` commands).
- Add the `tric ssh` command to allow opening a shell in a **running** stack service; differently from the `shell` command, the `ssh` command will **not** start the service if it's not already running.

## [0.5.16] - 2020-11-26

- Add support for the `TRIC_HOST` environment variable. This will override the default host machine IP address lookup `tric` would perform on Linux or the hard-wired `host.docker.internal` hostname `tric` would use on Windows and Mac host to set the default `xdebug.remote_host` value.
- Default to the host machin IP address to set `xdebug.remote_host` only if the host has not been set  by means of a call to `tric xdebug host <host>` or by setting the `XDH` environment variable explicitly.
- Fix an issue that would reset run settings stored in the `.env.tric.run` file when using the `tric xdebug <key> <value>` command.
- Correctly handle Docker network removal in parallel tasks to avoid "error while removing network" errors.
- Add support for `tric run` to run all the avaiable Codeception test suites from the target one after another.

## [0.5.15] - 2020-11-24

- Removed the 3s wait at start of the `codeception` service.
- Fixed (in the context of the [lucatume/dockerfiles](https://github.com/lucatume/dockerfiles) repository) an issue that would cause Codeception tests to exit `0` on failure and not `1` as expected.

## [0.5.14] - 2020-11-24

- Fixed volumes setup to make sure the volume, and the host file structure, created by WordPress container is owned by the current user and not `root`.
- Fixed and issue that would change, on Linux, the file modes of all the used plugins, to `a+rwx` when using the `run` command; fixes #36

## [0.5.13] - 2020-11-23

- Executing `tric use` without a target now attempts to set the current working directory as the target.
- `tric info` now outputs all valid targets, which is what `tric use` without a valid target used to do.
- The Composer prompt from `tric init` no longer appears if `composer.json` is not found, likewise for the NPM prompt if `package.json` is not found.
- Fixed an issue that would prevent the `npm` and `npm_lts` services from correctly returning their exit status.
- Add support for the `--pretty` flag to the `npm` and `npm_lts` commands to print a more human-readable output.

## [0.5.12] - 2020-11-11

- Fixed two issues in the `target` command where the command would fail if no previous target had been set.
- Set the start of the random network subnet pool for parallel processes used by the `target` command to a higher number to reduce the chance of running into overlapping pool issues.

## [0.5.11] - 2020-11-03

- Activate all debug options in the `wordpress` service.

## [0.5.7] - 2020-08-28

## [0.5.6] - 2020-08-27

- Fixed an issue where the terminal columns and lines detection would cause issue in CI context.
- Fixed an issue where the `npm` image would not build correctly in CI context.

## [0.5.5] - 2020-08-19

- Add support for the `bash` sub-command to the `tric cli` command to allow opening a `bash` shell into the `cli` container to manage the WordPress installation currently being served by `tric serve`.
